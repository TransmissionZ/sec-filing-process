1498710,20180213,20171231,"Under the RLA, our collective bargaining agreements generally do not expire, but instead become amendable as of a stated date.",
1498710,20180213,20171231,"At the end of a “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization and the airline each may resort to “self-help,” including, for the labor organization, a strike or other labor action, and for the airline, the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.",

1498710,20180213,20171231,"We cannot assure that our labor costs going forward will remain competitive because in the future our labor agreements may be amended or become amendable and new agreements could have terms with higher labor costs; one or more of our competitors may significantly reduce their labor costs, thereby reducing or eliminating our comparative advantages as to one or more of such competitors; or our labor costs may increase in connection with our growth.",
1498710,20180213,20171231,We may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future as non-unionized workers may unionize.,

1498710,20180213,20171231,"Under the RLA, collective bargaining agreements generally contain “amendable dates” rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB.",
1498710,20180213,20171231,"This process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement, or the parties have been released to “self-help” by the NMB.",
1498710,20180213,20171231,"In most circumstances, the RLA prohibits strikes; however, after release by the NMB, carriers and unions are free to engage in self-help measures such as lockouts and strikes.",
1498710,20180213,20171231,"Our flight operations were shut down due to a strike by our pilots beginning on June 12, 2010 and lasting until we and the union representing our pilots reached a tentative agreement for a new contract.",
1498710,20180213,20171231,"On August 1, 2010, we and the pilots’ union executed a five-year collective bargaining agreement.",
