0000857005	20131122	20130930	The acquisition of Servigistics has been accounted for as a business combination. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the October 2, 2012 acquisition date. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuations using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions provided by management of Servigistics and PTC. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates.  The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill.
0000857005	20151123	20150930	The unaudited financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of PTC and Servigistics, on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of PTC's fiscal year 2013.

In 2013, we recorded a tax benefit of $32.6 million to decrease our valuation allowance as a result of Servigistics' net deferred tax liabilities recorded in accounting for the business combination.  This tax benefit is excluded from the 2013 pro forma results The pro forma financial information is presented for comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of 2013.

The pro forma information for all periods presented includes the effects of business combination accounting resulting from the acquisition as though the acquisition had been consummated as of the beginning of fiscal year 2012, including amortization charges from acquired intangible assets, the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred support revenue being recorded in fiscal year 2012 versus fiscal year 2013, interest expense on borrowings in connection with the acquisition, the exclusion of acquisition-related costs and the related tax effects. In 2013, we recorded a tax benefit of $32.6 million to decrease our valuation allowance as a result of Servigistics' net deferred tax liabilities recorded in accounting for the business combination.  This tax benefit is excluded from the 2013 pro forma results and is reflected in the 2012 pro forma results because the deferred tax liabilities would have resulted in a lower tax charge when we established a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2012.  The pro forma financial information is presented for comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of 2012.

0000898173	20110228	20101231	Challenging macroeconomic conditions have lead to high levels of unemployment. Monthly U.S. unemployment rates for 2010 ranged from 9.4% to 9.9%. We believe that these unemployment rates and continued uncertainty in the overall economic health have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. We also believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money and can be an important factor in the consumers decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle. While the deferral of vehicle purchases has lead to an increase in vehicle maintenance, long term trends of high unemployment levels could reduce the number of total annual miles driven as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending habits, both of which could negatively impact our business.

0001021270	20170321	20170101	The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation method with the assumptions noted in the table below. Due to a lack of recent historical share option exercise experience, the Company uses a simplified method for estimating the expected life, as outlined in Accounting Standards Codification 718, calculated using the following formula: (vesting term + original contract term)/2. Expected volatilities are based on the movement of the Companys common stock over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of the option.

0001069878	20190214	20181231	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and eliminates the need to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities to measure goodwill impairment. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The guidance will be applied prospectively, and is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.

On October 29, 2010, the Department published final regulations covering a portion of the proposed gainful employment rules with an effective date of July 1, 2011. These rules would require proprietary institutions of higher education and public or not-for profit institutions offering postsecondary non-degree programs to provide prospective learners with each eligible programs occupations, costs, completion rate, job placement rate, and median loan debt of program completers. Institutions must annually submit information to the Department on learners who complete a program leading to gainful employment in a recognized occupation, including learner and program information, amount from private loans or institutional finance plans, matriculation information, and end of year enrollment information. Additionally, the final regulations require institutions to notify the Department at least 90 days before the first day of class when it intends to offer new educational programs leading to gainful employment in recognized occupations. New program notification includes information on the demand for the program, wage analysis, institutional program review and approval process, and demonstration of approval through the schools accreditation. Unless the Department requires approval for new programs, a school is not required to get approval after notification is submitted. If such approval is required, an alert notice will be sent to the school at least 30 days before the first day of class with a request

0001105705	20120224	20111231	In assessing Goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment review process is unnecessary. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment review process. In 2011, the Company elected not to perform a qualitative assessment for goodwill. The first step of the two-step process involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including Goodwill. In performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and, in certain cases, a combination of a DCF analysis and a market-based

0001105705	20110218	20101231	Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The     first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of     a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. In     performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value     of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow     (DCF) analysis and, in certain cases, a combination     of a DCF analysis and a market-based approach. Determining fair     value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including     judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth     rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, as     well as relevant comparable company earnings multiples for the     market-based approach. The cash flows employed in the DCF     analyses are based on the Companys most recent budgets and     business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have     been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period.

0001261654	20181130	20180930	On June 16, 2017, ED announced its intent to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the gainful employment regulations. ED convened meetings from December 2017 through March 2018, but negotiators failed to reach consensus on all key elements of the proposal.  ED published a proposed rule on August 14, 2018, on which it accepted public comment through September 13, 2018.  The proposed rule would eliminate the existing Gainful Employment regulations.  ED stated in the notice of proposed rulemaking that it plans instead, among other things, to publish program-level outcomes data using the existing government website called the College Scorecard, or on a new federal website.  ED has indicated the proposed regulations will not be published in final form by November 1, 2018, as would typically be required for them to take effect on July 1, 2019.  Regulations published after November 1, 2018 and prior to November 1, 2019 typically would take effect on July 1, 2020.
0001261654	20171201	20170930	In June 2017, ED announced its intent to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the gainful employment regulations. ED has announced that the committee will convene in December 2017 and in early 2018 and issue proposed regulations for public comment during the first half of 2018, but ED has not established a final schedule for publication of proposed or final regulations. Any regulations published in final form by November 1, 2018 typically would take effect on July 1, 2019.
0001261654	20191206	20190930	As described in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 30, 2018, ED’s gainful employment regulations include debt to earning (DE) metrics and disclosure requirements for program certifications, reporting and disclosure of program information and warnings. On July 1, 2019, ED issued final regulations that rescind the gainful employment regulations. The final regulations have an effective date of July 1, 2020.  However, ED stated in a June 28, 2019 electronic announcement that institutions may elect to immediately implement the new regulations.  Institutions that early implement the regulations will not be required to: report gainful employment data for the 2018-2019 award year; comply with requirements for including a gainful employment disclosure template in their promotional materials or for directly distributing the disclosure template to prospective students; post gainful employment disclosures on their web pages or comply with certification requirements for gainful employment.  ED stated in the electronic announcement that institutions that do not early implement the new regulations are expected to comply with the existing gainful employment regulations by July 1, 2020. We have early implemented the new regulations.

0001261654	20111130	20110930	ED promulgated final regulations on June 13, 2011, which will become effective on July 1, 2012, imposing additional Title IV Program eligibility requirements on certain educational programs. Our programs are subject to ED requirements that the programs prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The gainful employment regulations published on June 13, 2011 establish metrics for determining whether a program will qualify as such an educational program. For additional information on the metrics, see Business  Regulatory Environment  Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs  Program Integrity included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. If an academic program fails the applicable metrics in three out of four years, the academic program would become ineligible to participate in Title IV Program funding for at least three years. The gainful employment standards will be calculated on a fiscal year basis beginning with FFY 2012. The first year for which eligibility could be lost for a program is 2015, which would occur if the program fails all applicable standards for each of 2012, 2013, and 2014.
0001261654	20121128	20120930	Identifying employment opportunities and preparing our graduates for careers in the automotive, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle and marine industries is critical to our ability to help our graduates benefit from their education. Accordingly, we dedicate significant resources to maintaining an effective employment team. Our campus-based staff facilitates several career development processes, including instruction and coaching for interview skills and professionalism, provides reference materials and assistance with the composition of resumes and assists in part-time and graduate job searches.
0001261654	20151202	20150930	ED published a final gainful employment rule on October 31, 2014. Most parts of the new rule were effective on July 1, 2015, except new disclosure requirements which take effect January 1, 2017.  The final rule requires institutions to satisfy one of two debt-to-earnings ratios in order to maintain Title IV Program eligibility. The rule also requires institutions to make certain certifications respecting each of their gainful employment programs, to annually report certain information to ED, and to make disclosures to prospective students and the public. For a summary of the final rules, see “Business - Regulatory Environment - Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs - Gainful Employment”.  We are not able to develop reliable projections of our programs' performance under the final rules because the data previously provided by ED is dated and we do not have access to the recent Social Security Administration earnings data which will be used in the calculations.

We believe that our graduate employment services provide our students with a compelling value proposition and enhance the employment"
0001261654	20161130	20160930	ED published a final gainful employment rule on October 31, 2014. Most parts of the new rule were effective on July 1, 2015, except new disclosure requirements which take effect January 1, 2017. The final rule requires institutions to satisfy one of two debt-to-earnings (DE) ratios in order to maintain Title IV Program eligibility. The rule also requires institutions to make certain certifications respecting each of their gainful employment programs, to annually report certain information to ED, and to make disclosures to prospective students and the public.
0001261654	20141203	20140930	ED published the final gainful employment rule on October 31, 2014, which was the deadline in order for the new rule to take effect on July 1, 2015.  The final rule maintains the debt-to-earnings ratio and disclosure requirements published in ED’s March 2014 draft rule, but eliminates the proposed program cohort default rate. In addition to the debt-to-earnings calculations, the final rules include requirements for program certification and disclosure of program information and warnings.  For a summary of the final rules, see “Business - Regulatory Environment - Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs - Gainful Employment”.  We are not able to develop reliable estimates as to the potential outcome or impact of the final rules because the data previously provided by ED is dated and we do not have access to recent data which would be used in the calculations.

Such educational programs would include all of the Title IV-eligible educational programs at each of our institutions.  The gainful employment regulations will, among other things, measure each educational program against threshold benchmarks in each of three debt measure categories:  (1) an annual loan repayment rate, (2) an annual debt-to-annual earnings ratio, and (3) an annual debt-to-discretionary income ratio.  The various formulas are calculated under complex methodologies and definitions outlined in the regulations, and are based on data that may not be readily accessible to institutions.  If an educational program fails to achieve threshold rates in all three categories for one federal fiscal year (beginning with debt measures calculated for the 2012 federal fiscal year), the institution must, among other things, disclose the amount by which the program missed the minimum acceptable performance and the institution’s plan to improve the program. If an educational program fails to achieve threshold rates in all three categories in two out of three federal fiscal years, the institution must, among other things, warn students in the failing program that they should expect difficulty in repaying their loans, disclose the options available to the student if the program loses eligibility for Title IV funds, and disclose resources available to research other educa

Such educational programs would have included all of the Title IV-eligible educational programs at each of our institutions.  On June 30, 2012, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued a decision that vacated most of the gainful employment regulations and remanded those regulations to the DOE for further action.  On July 6, 2012, the DOE issued an electronic announcement acknowledging that the Court had vacated the repayment rate metric as well as the debt-to-income gainful employment metrics that would have gone into effect on July 1, 2012.  The DOE also noted that institutions are not required to comply with related regulations relating to gainful employment reporting requirements and adding new educational programs, but are required to comply with requirements to disclose certain information about educational programs.

These agreements also generally provide that know-how and inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us are our exclusive property.

Further, despite the existence of these agreements, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques.

0001362468	20090303	20081231	The airline industry is heavily unionized and the wages and benefits of unionized airline industry employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements. Conflicts between unionized airlines and their unions can lead to work slowdowns or stoppages. We currently have a non-unionized work force and are not subject to collective bargaining agreements at the present time. Our pilots and flight attendants have formed in-house associations to negotiate matters of concern with us. Further attempts are possible to unionize our flight attendants as the waiting period required by the National Mediation Board (NMB) has elapsed since the prior rejection of union representation in December 2006. If our employees were to unionize in the future and we were unable to reach agreement on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement, or we were to experience wide-spread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. In addition, we may be subject to disruption by organized labor groups protesting our non-union status. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our future results.

We have 83 collective bargaining agreements in place with 19 different unions representing our unionized employees. In September 2010, we declared impasse in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our Regulated Businesses. The prior agreement expired on July 31, 2010; however negotiations did not produce a new agreement. We implemented our last, best and final offer on January 1, 2011 in order to maintain health care coverage for our employees in accordance with terms of the offer. The unions have challenged our right to implement our last, best, and final offer. In this regard, following the filing by the Utility Workers Union of America of an unfair labor practice charge, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued a complaint against us in January 2012, claiming that we implemented the last, best and final offer without providing sufficient notice of the existence of a dispute with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, a state mediation agency, and several state departments of labor. We have asserted that we did, in fact, provide sufficient notice. A hearing date on the matter has not been set. In addition, six local unions filed grievances or demands for arbitration under their respective local collective bargaining agreements regarding our implementation of the last, best and final offer. In response, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the local unions in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking, among other things, an injunction preventing the unions from filing grievances or demanding arbitration under the local collective bargaining agreements with respect to the implementation of our last, b

In September 2010, we declared impasse in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our Regulated Businesses. The prior agreement expired on July 31, 2010, however negotiations did not produce a new agreement. The Company implemented our last, best and final offer in order not to disrupt health care coverage for our employees. At this time, we dont believe that this circumstance will result in a system wide work stoppage. However, management has developed contingency plans that will be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur. Management does not expect that such a work stoppage or strike would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Philip Morris Companies Inc., et al., District Court of Seward County, Kansas, filed February 7, 2000, we and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant cigarette companies engaged in an international conspiracy to fix wholesale prices of cigarettes and sought certification of a class comprised of all persons in Kansas who were indirect purchasers of cigarettes from the defendants. The plaintiff claims unspecified economic damages resulting from the alleged price-fixing, trebling of those damages under the Kansas price-fixing statute and counsel fees. The trial court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification and refused to permit the defendants to appeal. The case is now in the discovery phase. No trial date has yet been set.

Superior Court for the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, filed February 13, 2012, we, our subsidiaries, other members of the industry, certain companies allegedly involved in the purchase of tobacco leaf in Argentina, and certain companies allegedly involved in the manufacture of pesticides are defendants. Plaintiffs in this action are eight children born between the years of 1996 and 2008 and their families, all residing in Argentina. The plaintiffs claim that the children developed birth defects as a result of the exposure of their parents to pesticides while working on farms in Argentina. The plaintiffs allege that we, our subsidiaries, other members of the industry, and certain companies allegedly involved in the purchase of tobacco leaf in Argentina required the use of pesticides in tobacco growing while failing to warn tobacco growers of the risks. The plaintiffs claim unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Neither we nor our subsidiaries have been served with the complaint.

We do not have a liability on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010, as the fair value of these guarantees is insignificant due to the fact that the probability of future payments under these guarantees is remote.

We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business.

Under the 401(k) plan, eligible employees may elect to defer a portion of their compensation, within the limits prescribed by the Code, on a pre-tax or after-tax (Roth) basis through contributions to the 401(k) plan. The 401(k) plan authorizes employer safe harbor contributions. The 401(k) plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code. As a tax-qualified retirement plan, pre-tax contributions to the 401(k) plan and earnings on those pre-tax contributions are not taxable to the employees until distributed from the 401(k) plan, and earnings on Roth contributions are not taxable when distributed from the 401(k) plan.
